# PLAN-024: TheSuperHackers deterministic math (PR #2670) and cross-play

Status: **watching** (recorded 04/10/2026). Nothing to do until the PR is merged upstream.

## What is coming

TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode PR #2670 by Okladnoj, "feat(math): Route game logic math through
WWMath with 3-mode deterministic support". On 04/10/2026 it had one approving review from a
maintainer, all 25 checks green and no conflicts, so it can be merged at any time.

- About 200 direct C math calls in game logic (pathfinding, physics, weapons, ...) go through
  `WWMath` wrappers, with three modes: **VC6** (inline x87, retail), **CRT** (platform libm), and
  **GameMath** (fdlibm-based, bit-identical everywhere; FetchContent).
- `USE_DETERMINISTIC_MATH` (GameMath) is **on by default for every non-VC6 build**.
- `-ffp-contract=off`, `WWMath::Div_Safe()`, `Trig.cpp` redirected to `WWMath`.
- The author measured Windows x86 MSVC and macOS ARM64 with fdlibm at the same CRC (`76B53840`).

This port is cited in the PR thread as a case study (cross-play with the GeneralsOnline PC client
on native math). The owner posted a correction: we match the **VC6 client**, which needed
`(float)sin((double)x)` instead of bionic's `sinf` — see
`docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-cross-play-desync-method.md`.

## Update 05/10/2026 (from the PR thread)

- Okladnoj: GameMath is used **only when `RETAIL_COMPATIBLE_CRC` is off**; `BaseDefines.h` disables
  `USE_DETERMINISTIC_MATH` for a retail-compatible build. This port builds with
  `RETAIL_COMPATIBLE_CRC 0` (as the GeneralsOnline client), so **taking the PR switches us to
  GameMath automatically** -- step 1 below is not optional.
- His measurements match ours: native math on ARM64 (macOS clang) and Windows x64 gives
  0 differing lines; against 32-bit x86 (x87) it differs -- 22 lines at `_PC_53`, 338 at `_PC_24`.
  The GeneralsOnline PC client is VC6 x87 at `_PC_24`, the worst row; this port matches it by
  evaluating the hashed transcendentals in double and narrowing once (the lesson). Tests:
  https://github.com/Okladnoj/GeneralsGameCode/tree/okji/test/deterministic-math-v2.2.8/tests
- xezon doubts native math is enough across all CPUs and libms; fbraz3 (who cited this port)
  said it was raised for discussion only.

## Update 05/10/2026 (OmniBlade, TheSuperHackers)

- Our double-and-narrow works because the double CRT result is computed at higher precision and
  then rounded to float: as long as the rounding mode is the same and the double function's error
  is below a float's precision, the float comes out the same. It does **not** make transcendental
  functions return the same value on every platform and C runtime, and nothing can guarantee that.
  This matches what we measured, and it names the residual risk: a double result that lands within
  its error of a float rounding boundary narrows differently. Rare, and not seen in the 1946
  checkpoints of `Global_War*.rep`, but possible -- and it depends on bionic's libm, which could
  change between Android versions.
- **Long-term compatibility with the VC6 clients is not a TheSuperHackers goal**: it constrains
  engine improvements too much. So upstream will move to GameMath and stay there; holding the VC6
  contract is this port's job alone, for as long as the GeneralsOnline PC client is VC6.
- GameMath's performance is now close to the CRT's (sqrt intrinsics) -- so cost is no argument
  against switching once the PC client does.

Consequence for step 4 below: the day GeneralsOnline's Windows client moves to GameMath, this port
should switch at the same time; until then, keep the VC6 contract on the hashed path.

## How fast it reaches the PC client (checked 05/10/2026)

The GeneralsOnline client (github.com/GeneralsOnlineDevelopmentTeam/gameclient) is a TheSuperHackers
fork by a TheSuperHackers contributor (x64-dev), with `RETAIL_COMPATIBLE_CRC 0`, shipped as a modern
MSVC 32-bit build (`win32-vcpkg-optimized`), not VC6. It **tracks upstream continuously**: merges of
TheSuperHackers on 22-29/03, 22/05, 28/07, and upstream commits up to 04/09 arrived with the merge
of 25/09 -- every one to two months, a few weeks behind. Once #2670 is merged upstream, GameMath
will therefore reach the PC client by itself within about two months (it is on for every non-VC6
build), and the client's updater moves every PC player at once. Android must follow the same day.

So step 1 below becomes: as soon as #2670 is merged upstream, bring GameMath into this port behind a
per-match switch (both math paths built in; the one a match uses decided by the PC client's version,
like the logic CRC revision), so the day GeneralsOnline ships it costs no emergency release, and
players still on the old PC client can still play. Watch the client repository for
`USE_DETERMINISTIC_MATH` / GameMath arriving.

## Why it matters here

Cross-play with the PC works because this port reproduces what the GeneralsOnline Windows client
computes: VC6 CRT on 32-bit x87 (`sinf` promoted to double, `_PC_24`). The PC client does not use
GameMath or fdlibm. If the merge brings GameMath in as the default, our game logic stops computing
what the PC computes, and every Android-to-PC match desyncs — while Android-to-Android and replays
recorded on Android still agree, so it would not show up in local testing.

## What to do when it is merged

1. **Do not take the default blindly in the upstream sync.** AGENTS.md says "game logic: keep
   theirs"; for this PR that rule is wrong for us. Keep our math path matching the VC6 client:
   the CRT-style mode, with `Lib/trig.h` / `Trig.cpp` evaluating in double and narrowing once.
2. **Check what the PR's CRT mode actually does on bionic.** If its CRT mode calls `sinf`/`cosf`,
   it is not the VC6 contract; route the hashed path through the double-and-narrow pattern
   (lesson: "the rule for anything on the hashed path").
3. **Prove it with the replay check before shipping**: `Global_War.rep` and `Global_War2.rep`
   (1946 checkpoints) must still match the PC; then a live match against a PC.
4. **Ask the GeneralsOnline team** whether their Windows client will adopt GameMath. If it does,
   switch to GameMath on our side at the same time and re-run step 3 against their new build —
   then the double-and-narrow patches become unnecessary.
5. Retail replays stay on the VC6 contract either way.
