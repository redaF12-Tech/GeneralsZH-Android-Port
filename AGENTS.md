# GeneralsX: Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## What I Am
GeneralsX is a cross-platform port of Command & Conquer: Generals Zero Hour, porting
legacy Windows DirectX 8 + Miles Sound code to a modern stack (SDL3 + DXVK + OpenAL +
64-bit). This fork's active focus is **Android** — including GeneralsOnline, a
from-scratch NGMP-based online multiplayer backend replacing the long-dead GameSpy
servers (lobby, custom match, quickmatch, persona/stats, social). The macOS and
iOS/iPadOS builds are inherited from the project this repository was forked from and
are **not maintained here** (see `docs/port/APPLE_PLATFORMS.md`). This is a **massive C++ game engine** (~500k LOC) preserving retail gameplay
while modernizing the platform layer.

## Must-Load Context
Before starting work, read:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` – quick reference
- `.github/instructions/generalsx.instructions.md` – full architecture
- `.github/instructions/git-commit.instructions.md` – commit standards
- `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md` – documentation workflow
- `docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md` – Android port + GeneralsOnline multiplayer: architecture, device matrix, bring-up log
- `docs/DEV_BLOG/YYYY-MM-DIARY.md` – current development notes

## Key Entry Points
- `GeneralsMD/Code/Main/SDL3Main.cpp` – Android/Linux/macOS/iOS entry point
- `Generals/Code/Main/WinMain.cpp`
- `Core/GameEngineDevice/Source/`
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/GameNetwork/GeneralsOnline/` – multiplayer backend client
- `android/` – Gradle shell app (SDLActivity), Setup/FolderPicker/LogViewer/GeneralsOnline-account activities
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/SDL3GameEngine.cpp` – touch gesture state machine
- `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/SDL3Device/GameClient/TouchInput.cpp` – what a gesture means, resolved by the engine's own rules

## Platform Focus
- **Active**: Android (`android-vulkan`) — the only target this fork develops and tests
- **Inherited, not maintained**: macOS (`macos-vulkan`), iOS/iPadOS (`ios-vulkan`) — kept
  building where shared code allows, but no work is spent on them; Linux (`linux64-deploy`)
  is used only as a host for tooling
- **Future/Exploratory**: Windows (MinGW path, issue #29)
- **Legacy**: VC6 + DirectX 8 + Miles (reference only)

## Architecture
| Layer   | Technology          | Replaces                     |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Graphics| DXVK                | DirectX 8 (d3d8.dll)         |
| Windowing| SDL3              | Win32 API                    |
| Audio   | OpenAL              | Miles Sound System           |
| Video   | FFmpeg              | Bink Video (intro/videos)    |
| Platform| SDL3 + libc         | Win32 POSIX calls            |

**CRITICAL**: Platform code must be isolated to `Core/GameEngineDevice/` and `Core/Libraries/Source/Platform/`. No native Win32/Cocoa/X11 calls in game logic.

## Golden Rules
1. **Single codebase** – Linux and macOS build from same source
2. **SDL3 everywhere** – No native platform calls in game code
3. **DXVK everywhere** – DX8 → Vulkan translation on all platforms
4. **OpenAL everywhere** – Cross-platform audio stack
5. **64-bit native** – x86_64 only (32-bit via VC6 upstream)
6. **Retail compatibility** – Original replays and mods must work
7. **Determinism** – Rendering/audio changes must not affect gameplay logic
8. **No band-aids** – Fix underlying issues, not symptoms
9. **Update dev blog** – `docs/DEV_BLOG/YYYY-MM-DIARY.md` before committing
10. **Reference repos** – Study patterns, don't copy-paste

## Reference Repositories
- **fighter19-dxvk-port** – Primary graphics/platform reference (DXVK + SDL3 on Linux)
- **jmarshall-win64-modern** – Audio reference (OpenAL implementation, Generals-only)
- **thesuperhackers-main** – Upstream baseline for regression checks

## Build Commands

### Android — build locally, do NOT use CI
**The repository owner has a limited Actions budget and has asked repeatedly for
local builds only.** A push does NOT trigger CI (the `push:` trigger was removed
on 01/08/2026 precisely because unattended builds were burning the budget), so
the only way to start one is `workflow_dispatch` — do not. Build here and copy
the APK into `apk/`, then push, so the download link is a raw GitHub URL:

```bash
./scripts/build/android/build-dual-hz.sh   # both engines: libmain.so 30 Hz + libmain60.so 60 Hz
cp GeneralsXZH-android-local.apk apk/<name>.apk
```

Use `build-dual-hz.sh`, not `build-local-sandboxed.sh`: the latter leaves
`SAGE_HIGH_FPS_SIM` at its OFF default and ships a 30 Hz engine only. Both
engines must be built from the same working tree — if a source edit lands
between the two passes, the APK carries two engines that differ in more than
the tick rate.

Work and push on the diagnostics branch (`claude/network-diagnostics`), never directly on
`main`: `main` only accumulates confirmed results, and is fast-forwarded to the branch when the
repository owner says so.

If `GITVERSE_TOKEN` and `GITVERSE_REPO` are set, also mirror the APK to GitVerse for testers who
cannot reach GitHub: `./scripts/build/android/publish-apk-gitverse.sh apk/<name>.apk` (one commit on
the `apk` branch as a `.zip` holding the APK, replaced each time; prints the direct link). Give both links.

Keep only the current build in `apk/`: `git rm` the previous APK when adding a new one. Every
APK is ~60 MB of permanent git history.

**Give the user the APK link first, at the top of the reply, not at the end.**

**Releases** are published from the local build too: bump `versionName`/`versionCode` in
`android/app/build.gradle`, build with `build-dual-hz.sh`, commit the APK as the one file in `apk/`
and the notes (plus the symbol tables of both engines) under `docs/releases/v<version>/`, push to
`main`, then run `Actions → Publish Android Release` with the version. It builds nothing, so it
costs seconds.

CI (`Actions tab → Build Android → Run workflow`) still exists for release
artifacts and the symbol bundle. For a local build's prerequisites see
`docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md §3`:
```bash
git submodule update --init references/fbraz3-dxvk
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/<version>
./scripts/build/android/build-android-zh.sh
./scripts/build/android/package-android-zh.sh --install
```

### Docker (recommended on Linux host)
```bash
# Linux build
./scripts/build/linux/docker-configure-linux.sh linux64-deploy
./scripts/build/linux/docker-build-linux-zh.sh linux64-deploy

# Optional: Windows via MinGW cross-build
./scripts/build/linux/docker-build-mingw-zh.sh mingw-w64-i686
```

### Native Linux
```bash
cmake --preset linux64-deploy
cmake --build build/linux64-deploy --target z_generals
```

### Native macOS
```bash
cmake --preset macos-vulkan
cmake --build build/macos-vulkan --target z_generals
```

## Target Priority
1. **GeneralsXZH** (Zero Hour) – Primary target, most feature-complete
2. **GeneralsX** (Base game) – Backport only when changes are clearly shared

## Backport Rules
**Backport to Generals when:**
- Change is platform/backend code (SDL3, DXVK, OpenAL)
- Change is in shared Core libraries
- Change is low-risk and clearly applicable

**Do NOT backport:**
- Zero Hour-specific gameplay/logic
- Expansion-specific features
- High-risk changes to Zero Hour

## DXVK Source of Truth (macOS)
- Default: GitHub fork branch `generalsx-macos-v2.6` (auto-update enabled)
- Local mode: `-DSAGE_DXVK_USE_LOCAL_FORK=ON`
- **Rule**: Never edit files in `build/_deps/...` directly. Always commit fixes in fork repo first.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Linux case sensitivity**: Include paths must match exact case. Use `scripts/tooling/cpp/fixIncludesCase.sh`.
- **DXVK needs Vulkan**: Install `vulkan-tools`, `mesa-vulkan-drivers` or GPU drivers.
- **-logToCon only in debug**: Available only with `RTS_BUILD_OPTION_DEBUG=ON`.
- **SDL3 from source**: Fetched via CMake FetchContent. No system package needed.
- **Manual memory**: Always delete/delete[]. Use STLPort for VC6 legacy builds.
- **Debug options break replays**: Use `RTS_BUILD_OPTION_DEBUG=OFF` for replay tests.
- **Touch input is not a mouse**: do NOT fix a control bug by synthesizing
  `MSG_RAW_MOUSE_*`. A pointer has five properties a finger does not (a position
  when nothing is pressed, hover, the ability to rest near a screen edge, a
  guaranteed release for every press, being singular), and the translator chain
  depends on all five — that mismatch, not five separate bugs, is what produced
  the placement ghost on the wrong widget, the camera that scrolled by itself,
  the frozen ability radius and the tooltip that would not stay up. Battlefield
  input goes through `TouchInput.cpp` instead, using `pickDrawable` /
  `screenToTerrain` / `evaluateContextCommand`. Read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-touch-input-is-not-a-mouse.md` **before** touching
  input code; it also covers the two patterns that keep recurring (preview code
  must be told the aim point rather than reading the mouse; engine state a mouse
  would refresh every frame must be re-asserted, not hunted).
- **Rendering correct on Vulkan but wrong on GLES (or vice versa)**: almost always a D3D↔GL
  *convention* mismatch, not a logic bug — the engine's D3D-era corrections (half-pixel offset,
  viewport Y origin, clip-space Y, render-target texture origin, default address mode) are
  right under DXVK and wrong under the native GLES backend. Read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-d3d-vs-gl-rasterization-conventions.md` **before** hypothesis-hunting;
  it lists the known instances and the debugging method (measure the transform's *output*, not
  its inputs).
- **A D3D state value that "cannot have meant that"**: in a translation layer, zero is a
  VALUE, not "unset" (`D3DRS_STENCILMASK`/`STENCILWRITEMASK`/`COLORWRITEENABLE` of 0 all mean
  "none"), D3D state is unsigned (`DWORD` -> `GLint` silently turns `0x80808080` into a
  negative that GL clamps to 0), and an unimplemented fixed-function op must warn rather than
  be silently approximated. Every `x ? x : DEFAULT` in a state translator is a latent bug of
  this kind; seed the API's documented defaults instead. Three GLES-only visual bugs in this
  port came from exactly this -- read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-d3d-state-value-semantics.md`, which also records which
  diagnostics were blind to it and why.
- **Lockstep CRC desync against the PC client**: do NOT start from floating-point
  theory, and do NOT build a Windows or x86 reference binary -- one was brought up
  for this and abandoned. The PC client's full source is on the dev machine at
  `/home/user/generalsonlinedevelopmentteam/gameclient`, so this is a *diff*, and a
  `.rep` recorded on the PC carries the x86 checksums inside it, so a phone alone
  can compare frame by frame. The architecture is already measured innocent
  (aarch64 and x86_64 agree bit-for-bit); what actually differs is the **libm
  behind identical source** -- the client's VC6 CRT promotes `sinf` to double and
  evaluates on x87, bionic does not. Read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-cross-play-desync-method.md` **before** forming a
  hypothesis: it lists what is already ruled out with measurements, which files are
  audited clean, how to aim the per-object CRC trace (it cut 317 objects to 11),
  and which replays to ask for.
- **Slow/stuttering on the native GLES backend**: check the D3D8 **lock/usage flags** before
  anything else. `D3DLOCK_DISCARD`/`D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE` and the lock's `offset`/`size` are a
  synchronization contract; dropping them turns every dynamic-buffer update into a GPU stall,
  which is what cost this port ~45 fps. Cost that scales with *call count* and is flat per call
  means waiting, not working. Read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-gles-dynamic-buffer-stalls.md` — it also documents the
  per-subsystem draw and UI-time counters (`[d3d8gles] perf-draws/frame by source:`,
  `[d3d8gles] perf-ui ms/frame:`) that attribute a frame's cost from a device log.
- **Flicker on Mali only, on dynamic draws only, after touching buffer uploads**: the Mali driver
  caches a scanned index range per buffer until a GL call modifies the buffer; a `memcpy` into a
  persistent mapping is not one. Never persistently map index data that is refilled in place --
  stream it into never-reused bytes. Read `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-gles-persistent-buffers-mali.md`,
  which also lists every perf counter now in the log and the order that found each cost.

- **Interface size / bigger buttons**: no resolution or render trick makes a button bigger --
  every `.wnd` is stretched to the whole screen. `GXUiScale` scales chosen layouts as they are
  parsed, and hand-placed windows (control bar scheme, group panel) must use the same transform.
  Test overlaps against the windows on the retail `.wnd`, never against a bounding box. Read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-interface-scale-layouts.md` before touching a layout rule.
- **Upscaler, shadows, periodic hitches on GLES**: the upscaler renders the *scene* below the
  screen's resolution and draws everything after it 1:1 (GLES/ANGLE only); stencil shadow volumes
  must stay two-pass (one pass wraps a -1 into columns under aircraft); a hitch with a fixed period
  was a sysfs read on the engine's thread. Read
  `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSON-gles-upscaler-and-frame-pacing.md`.

- **Launcher strings ship in every language**: a new or changed string in
  `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` goes into every `values-*/strings.xml`
  (ar, b+isv, de, es, fa, fr, ko, pl, pt-rBR, ru, uk, zh) in the same commit -- not only
  English and Russian. Check: every locale has the same set of string names as `values/`.

## Branching & Sync
### TheSuperHackers upstream sync
```bash
git remote add thesuperhackers git@github.com:TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode.git
git fetch thesuperhackers
git merge thesuperhackers/main
```

**Conflict resolution**:
- Platform code (`Core/GameEngineDevice/`): keep ours
- Game logic (`GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/`): keep theirs
- Build system: merge carefully, test both versions

## Code Conventions
- **Annotate changes**: `// GeneralsX @keyword author DD/MM/YYYY Description`
- **Keywords**: `@bugfix` / `@feature` / `@performance` / `@refactor` / `@tweak` / `@build`
- **Attribution**: Add upstream PR references with author and GitHub URL
- **English only**: All code, comments, documentation
- **No lazy code**: No empty stubs, empty catch blocks, or commented-out code

## GitHub PR/Issue Formatting
- Use `--body-file` with real Markdown file instead of `--body`
- Avoid literal `\n` sequences; prefer actual newlines in multi-line strings

## VS Code Tasks
- Prefer task-first execution for build/test/debug
- Logs captured to `logs/` directory
- Primary labels: `[Linux]`, `[macOS]`, `[Linux] Pipeline: Build + Deploy + Run ZH`

## Docs Workflow
1. Monthly diary in `docs/DEV_BLOG/YYYY-MM-DIARY.md` (YYYY=year, MM=month only, e.g., `2026-05-DIARY.md`)
2. Active work notes in `docs/WORKDIR/` (phases/planning/reports/support/audit/lessons)
3. Step-by-step tutorials in `docs/HOWTO/` (user-facing guides for common tasks)
4. Never drop working docs directly under `docs/` root

## GitHub CLI Examples
**Create issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Brief, actionable title" \
  --body "## Context\n...\n## Goal\n...\n## Acceptance Criteria\n..." \
  --label bug --label Linux
```

**Create PRs (use temp file for body):**
```bash
cat > /tmp/pr-body.md << 'EOF'
## Description
Fixes #123

## Changes
- Platform isolation
EOF
gh pr create --title "Description" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

**Verify PR body (check for literal \n):**
```bash
body=$(gh pr view <number> --json body --jq .body)
printf "%s" "$body" | rg '\\n' && echo "HAS_LITERAL_BACKSLASH_N=YES" || echo "HAS_LITERAL_BACKSLASH_N=NO"
```
